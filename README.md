# jkpre

## 1. What is jkpre
jkpre is a library that helps Data Scientists and Engineers to more quickly perform preprocessing and exploratory tasks in a data pipeline by providing specific methods that massage the data in place or return visualization based on current data instances.

## 2. Current status
Currently, jkpre is in development, i.e. its codebase is preliminary both in terms of breath of functionality and predictability of behavior. Additionally, the *setup.py* file does currently not contain all necessary dependencies that are listed in *requirements.txt*. Not all imports listed in *requirements.txt* are required to run the code. The packages is thus currently not meant for use, as its functionality will be volatile.

## 3. Currently supported functionality
Currently, jkpre supports only the splitting of data into categorical and continuous subtables as well as few methodsfor quickly getting correlation matrices for these subtables. Later versions will include further functionalities.
